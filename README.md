This project combines our knowledge of mathematics, economics, and computer engineering to develop a comprehensive study exploring the predictive power of machine learning in the context of index rebalancing and its subsequent impact on stock prices. Drawing inspiration from our shared fascination with quantitative finance, we sought to construct a robust trading strategy and assess its profitability. Building upon existing research and literature, we embarked on collecting and preprocessing extensive datasets. Through the application of linear regression, we derived an equation that assigned weights to individual input variables based on their efficacy in forecasting price effects. Our findings shed light on the potential for machine learning techniques to enhance understanding and decision-making in the realm of financial markets, presenting a promising avenue for further exploration and refinement of predictive models.
